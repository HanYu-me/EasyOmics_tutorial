Each function in EasyOmics is independent, allowing users to input data, adjust parameters, run analyses, and visualize results with simple point-and-click actions.

The sidebar contains a menu to select the corresponding page, a selection list for analysis functions, a file upload panel, a parameter control panel, and an action button. The main panel visualizes the analysis output and displays feedback.

This significantly simplifies population-scale omics data analysis, making it more convenient for biologists to perform a series of omics analyses.

In EasyOmics workflow, GWAs function can perform association analysis between genotype and phenotype and find QTLs with significant association. Omics QTL function treats omic data as molecular phenotype and tests the association with genotypic data. MR function integrates the QTLs and OmicQTLs to perform causal inference. OmicsWAS tests the association between phenotypic and omics data.

## Introduction
A graphical interface for population-scale omics data association, integration and visualization

EasyOmics is an R Shiny application with a graphic user interface (GUI) application that integrates the Omic data for GWAS analysis. It is a user-friendly application that allows users to perform association analysis locally without any coding.

Moreover, it simplifies data compatibility issues across various analysis tools, requiring only VCF, GFF, and phenotype TXT files.

The analysis parameters of invoked tools are automatically set to default values, which reduces the complexity of parameter setting for users.

Parameters also could be adjusted by users in the "Other Parameters" input text box of every analysis function.
The setted parameters are the main invoked softwares' parameters. Please see "Citation" for the main invoked softwares' references.


|Function|Description|
| ----------- | ----------- |
|**Data Matching**|Preparing input files for subsequent analysis. |
|**Phenotype Analysis**|Providing critical insights into the input data characteristics and facilitates the detection of outlier values.|

## File Stream of Workflow

This is the file stream of the workflow in EasyOmics. Only four input files need users to perpare. The phenotype data (txt), genotype data (vcf), genome annotation data(gff), and omic data(txt).
